Glove:

0. Copy audio files to sound board.
(It works as a flash USB)

1. Get Arduino:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

2. Build the circuits:
Check out the folder called Circuits.
You might want to build it by parts to check out the libraries.

3. Libraries:
Libraries for the 3 components: color sensor, trinket, and sound driver;

* Trinket: 
1) Go to Arduino --> Preferences (also accessible with ctrl+comma)
2) In the Additional Boards Manager URL box, paste "https://adafruit.github.io/arduino-board-index/package_adafruit_index.json"
3) Go to Tools --> Boards: Arduino/Genuino UNO --> Boards Manager
4) Search "Trinket" and click on the result that pops up. Click on "install."


* Color Sensor Library: 
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TCS34725
1) Manually download from github
2) Go to Sketch --> Include libraries --> Libraries Manager. Type "Color Sensor" in the search to ensure it is installed.

* Sound Board Library: 
Go to Sketch --> Include libraries --> Libraries Manager. Type "Sound" in the search. Find the "Adafruit Soundboard Library" and click on it. Then click on the "install" button.

* Uv-Vis-IR Sensor:
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SI1145_Library
1) Manually download from github
2) Go to Sketch --> Include libraries --> Libraries Manager. Type "UV Sensor" in the search to ensure it is installed.


5. Uploading Arduino Code to Trinket: 

1) Go to Tools --> Board. Select the "Pro Trinket 5V/16MHz (USB)"
2) Go to Tools --> Programmer. Select the "USBTinyISP"
3) Press the checkmark to verify the sketch
4) Press the reset button (on the arduino trinket), and while the red light is flashing, press the upload button (right arrow key in green circle).

4. Test some hardware:

* Color Sensor Library:

* Sound Board Library: 

* UV Sensor:

* Volume Test

5. Color view.

6. Build the all circuits.

7. When you are ready, design the set-up for including it into a glove.
